changes: 
  - tweak: "Bunch of virus changes. Buckle up, kiddo. Praise Nurgle"
  - rscadd: "Adds Space Cold event. Spawns a harmless virus that can be treated with cold medicine. Unless you're irradiated and it mutates to kill everyone I guess."
  - rscadd: "Adds space cold medicine (dextra-something) to white first aid boxes. Can also be made by mixing paracetamol+sugar. Eating it will stop weak viruses symptoms from manifesting."
  - rscadd: "Humans now have crude immune system simulation. Keeping your immunity high makes it easier to shrug off viruses, extremely low (15% and less) immunity can get you random space cold-level infections. Get lemons for boosting it, spaceacilin ruins it. It recovers to norm over time."
  - tweak: "Spaceacillin now ODs at 15u instead of 30u."
  - tweak: "Spaceacillin now metabolizes faster. It was 60+ minutes for 15u, 30 minutes now."
  - tweak: "Spaceacillin boosts immune system effective rating. It acts as a multiplier to natural one, from 1x at none in blood to 2x at OD threshold (15u), and you can go higher if you don't mind ODing. Also if natural immunity is lower than the boost, boost would just replace it."
  - tweak: "Spaceacillin has three stages now. Below 10 units it acts kinda like now, blocking badness 2 virus effects. Virus would still progress though, but effects won't fire. It's enough for any random event virus effects."
  - tweak: "Above 10 units it would completely stop progression of badness 2 viruses and stop effects of badness 3 - which is usual stuff ou get from viro labs. Again, clock will still be ticking. Also at this stage it starts lowering your natural immunity value."
  - tweak: "And then, there's OD. OD stops badness 4 (e.g. Gibbingtons) from manifesting, and stops ticking of lower viruses. It screws your immune system even stronger too."
  - tweak: "It's also not 100% protecting you from infection now. 15u and above give old 100% protection, scaling with lower value in blood."
  - tweak: "Some tweaks to virus annoyningness. Hard delay between firings (25-40 seconds between message-only syndromes), emote syndromes (groaning, moaning, screaming) are now single syndrome to make it rarer. Internals actually stopping you from spreading viruses. No airborne viruses in vacuum."
  - tweak: "As an unrealated bonus, first aid (white and fire) boxes now have paracetamol bottles because damn it's easier to score opiates than that."
  - tweak: "Oh also remember how when you graft yourself Tajaran arms it kills you? Not when your immunity is floored. Just saying."
